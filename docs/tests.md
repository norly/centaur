Automated testing
=================

centaur comes with a suite of automated tests. Run
    make check
in the top-level directory to build elfucli and run the tests.

Temporary files will be created in tests/build/ and cleaned
up on 'make clean'.

See the test scripts themselves for more specific documentation.
